Start terminal 1
Run commands
	source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	export ROS_IP=192.168.3.210
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.3.210:11311
	cd catkin_ws
	catkin_make

When you run catkin_make, some packages are broken, just go to home/catkin_ws/src
and delete those broken packages. I think the folder with issues is called robot_robot just delete it.
When catkin_make brings an error it usually shows which directory has a problem..delete the folder in src with the error.
let me know if you fail to find them.
After you delete the broken packages
After you delete the broken packages just copy and paste the folders robot_0, robot_1, robot_2
into the directory home/catkin_ws/src. Then run these commands:
	cd catkin_ws
	catkin_make
	roscore
The catkin_make command has to be run in the catkin_ws directory


Start terminal 2

	source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

	roslaunch robots bots_3.launch //launches the three simulated robots

After launching the simulated robots, you can run them directly from Simulink
by just executing one model after the other.

Since it is simulated robots, they dont have IP address so to run the C++ files,
Make sure you stop the simulink models before running these:
